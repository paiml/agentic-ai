### Output Validation

**Demo 2 Output**:
```
⚠️  Demo 2: Overflow Detection & Recovery
   Attempting overflow: Large + Large...
   ❌ Error (expected): overflow
   🔄 Adder restarts: 1
```
✅ Correctly detects overflow and restarts

**Demo 4 Output**:
```
🔥 Demo 4: Multiple Failures
   Crash attempt #1...
   Crash attempt #2...
   Crash attempt #3...
   🔄 Multiplier restarts: 2
   ⚡ Supervisor escalated (budget exhausted)
```
✅ Correctly exhausts budget and escalates

**Demo 5 Output**:
```
⚡ Demo 5: Performance Test
   Completed 1000 operations
```
✅ Successfully handles bulk operations

### Recommendations

**Current Coverage (90%)** significantly exceeds 80% requirement for:
- ✅ Supervision pattern demonstration
- ✅ Error detection and recovery
- ✅ Budget management
- ✅ Escalation behavior
- ✅ Performance characteristics

**Future Enhancements** for 100% coverage would require:
