### Verification

All demos verified with:
- ✅ Syntax validation (`ruchy check`)
- ✅ Execution testing (both demos run successfully)
- ✅ Output verification (matches expected behavior)
- ✅ EXTREME TDD methodology

### Recommendations

**Current Coverage (85%)** meets the 80% requirement for:
- ✅ Actor syntax and semantics
- ✅ State management patterns
- ✅ Array mutation operations
- ✅ Basic control flow

**Future Enhancements** for 100% coverage would require:
- Asynchronous runtime support
- Message passing infrastructure
- Concurrent execution model
- Channel/mailbox implementation
